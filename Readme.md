Project Description:

This project is a login page featuring form fields for user input (such as name and email), checkboxes for user agreements, and a distinct mechanical-themed design. The interactive elements resemble a "Rube Goldberg" style machine, where each component visually represents movement and function, making the user experience engaging and memorable.

Key Features:

1. User Input Fields: Name and email fields are provided for user data entry.


2. Checkbox: A custom checkbox to agree to terms, styled in line with the mechanical theme.


3. Stylized Visuals: The combination of gears, levers, and pointing hands gives a dynamic and animated appearance.


4. User-Friendly Layout: Despite its creative design, the layout is simple and ensures functionality.



Technologies Used:

HTML: The structure and elements of the login form, including input fields, labels, and sections for design.

CSS: Custom styles to enhance the aesthetics, including:

Positioning and styling of elements such as gears, weights, and hands.

Use of animations and transitions to give motion to static elements.

Typography and visual hierarchy for the login form.


JavaScript: Adds interactivity to the page by:

Handling form submissions and validations.

Managing dynamic animations for the mechanical components.

Implementing any hover effects or animations triggered by user interactions.



This project demonstrates creativity and effective use of front-end development tools to create a memorable and engaging login interface.
